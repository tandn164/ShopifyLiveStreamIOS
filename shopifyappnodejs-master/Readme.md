# Shopify App using NodeJS

This project will help you get started. It has sample code to allow a store to install your app(free) and get a token for the store. This token will allow you to make API calls to Shopify.

## Permission Scope

This project scope is: read_products,write_products but you can change this for your app.

## Note
**You must add a .env file to your project to save your app settings. Make sure you don't commit this file to your source code**

## Make your app available on the internet from your localhost

I'm using ngrok.com to tunnel traffic from the web to my localhost app.

Videos about this app are on youtube.com/user/videocode2

Make sure you install https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv for the .env file to work.
